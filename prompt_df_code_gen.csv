3: The overall logic is correct, but there are some noticeable mistakes that makes the result wrong. 
2: The code has bad logic, resulting in wrong execution outputs
1: The code completely makes no sense, and the output is wrong.


Efficiency (1-5): 
5: The algorithm runs at the best time and space complexity, optimized to the best possible 
4: The algorithm runs well enough, but can be further optimized to get better performance
3: The algorithm adopts a suboptimal method for moderate performances
2: The algorithm adopted is bad designed and will suffer for large inputs.
1: The code has very poor time complexity, making it unusable for non-trivial input sizes.


Readability (1-5):
5: The code is extremely clear and simple. Every line is easy for human to understand, with no unnecessary complexity.
4: The code is generally clear and simple, with minor complexities or ambiguities that do not hinder understanding.
3: The code is readable but contains some complex or ambiguous parts.

For the question:
\nIf we list all the natural numbers below $10$ that are multiples of $3$ or $5$, we get $3, 5, 6$ and $9$. The sum of these multiples is $23$.
Find the sum of all the multiples of $3$ or $5$ below $1000$.
\n

The ground truth Answer of this question is:
\n

def compute():
	ans = sum(x for x in range(1000) if (x % 3 == 0 or x % 5 == 0))
	return str(ans)


if __name__ == ""__main__"":
	print(compute())
\n

Rate how good the following code is:
\n

result = 0
for number in range(1000):
    if (number % 3) == 0 or (number % 5) == 0:
        result += number
print(result)

For the question:
\n$145$ is a curious number, as $1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145$.
Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.

""""""
We will try to try to write ten as the sum of primes in the first five different ways.
If one of those ways succeed we don't need any primes in the following ones.
That way we can write (a+b)∗(a+b)∗(a+c)∗(b+c)∗(b+c)∗(c+d)=1000×1000×1000×1000×1000∗1000≡100,500×475≡625.
As we know that 10 = 5∗5∗5∗5×5∗15≡20, we know that we can write ten by:
(10–2)∗(10–2)∗(10–2)∗(10–2)×2∗(10–2)∗(10–2)∗(10–2)∗(10–2)∗(10–2)∗(10–2)=1000×1000×1000×10000≡100,500×475≡625.
10 = 2∗2∗2∗2∗2∗2∗4×2∗2∗2∗8, that implies that we can not write ten by: (10–2)×(10–2)∗(10–2)×(10–2)∗(10–2)×(10–2),
which is what we want. That's why we stop trying any further primes.
That's why we need only five primes.

This is not the ""easy"" question to answer.
But we have an interview and we are going to write our answers as an array of primes.
Every prime element in the array corresponds to one attempt to write ten by one of the solutions found.
If we have an array of five primes, then is the result at least a sum of these primes for a few, and also
a single value. If a primes solution doesn't give a sum, the array is not feasible.

We need five primes to put an ""easy"" question:
What is the first combination of primes that can be summed by 10?

We consider the first five primes as follows:
4 = 2∗2∗2∗2∗2∗2∗2∗2∗2∗8, the next two are 4∗4×4∗4×4∗4 and 4∗4×4∗4×4∗4∗4 = 2⋅2∗2∗2∗2∗4.
3 = 6∗6×3∗6∗3×3∗3∗6, the next four are 2∗2∗2∗2∗2∗2∗3∗2∗2∗2x3∗3∗6
2 = 12∗12∗12∗12∗12∗12∗12∗12∗12∗12∗12∗12x4, the next five are 2∗2∗2⋅2∗2∗2∗2∗2∗2∗2∗2x2∗2x4.
The next five can be seen as two primes summing to 12.

For the question:
\nA common security method used for online banking is to ask the user for three random characters from a passcode. For example, if the passcode was 531278, they may ask for the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th characters; the expected reply would be: 317.
The text file, keylog.txt, contains fifty successful login attempts.
Given that the three characters are always asked for in order, analyse the file so as to determine the shortest possible secret passcode of unknown length.

For the question:
\nUsing all of the digits $1$ through $9$ and concatenating them freely to form decimal integers, different sets can be formed. Interestingly with the set $\{2,5,47,89,631\}$, all of the elements belonging to it are prime.
How many distinct sets containing each of the digits one through nine exactly once contain only prime elements?

For the question:
\nThe number $512$ is interesting because it is equal to the sum of its digits raised to some power: $5 + 1 + 2 = 8$, and $8^3 = 512$. Another example of a number with this property is $614656 = 28^4$.
We shall define $a_n$ to be the $n$th term of this sequence and insist that a number must contain at least two digits to have a sum.

For the question:
\n
Consider the divisors of $30$: $1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30$.
It can be seen that for every divisor $d$ of $30$, $d + 30 / d$ is prime.


Find the sum of all positive integers $n$ not exceeding $100\,000\,000$such that for every divisor $d$ of $n$, $d + n / d$ is prime.


\n

The ground truth Answer of this question is:
\n
import eulerlib, math


def compute():
	LIMIT = 10**8
	
	isprime = eulerlib.list_primality(LIMIT + 1)
	
	def is_prime_generating(n):
		return all(
			(n % d != 0 or isprime[d + n // d])
			for d in range(2, math.isqrt(n) + 1))
	
	ans = sum(n for n in range(LIMIT + 1)
		if isprime[n + 1] and is_prime_generating(n))
	return str(ans)

Evaluation Form (You should only give scores between 1-5 as described above):
**Correctness:** 
**Efficiency:** 
**Readability:**",1.8,1.6,2.2
500,"You will be given a code that is designed to solve a math programming problem.

Your task is to evaluate the quality of this code from three perspectives:

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. 

Evaluation Criteria:

Correctness (1-5)：
5: The code provides the right result, and the procedure in the code is flawless
4: The overall logic is correct, it only made a small mistake (didn't print out the answer, wrong range, etc.) that makes the output wrong.
3: The overall logic is correct, but there are some noticeable mistakes that makes the result wrong. 
2: The code has bad logic, resulting in wrong execution outputs
1: The code completely makes no sense, and the output is wrong.


Efficiency (1-5): 
5: The algorithm runs at the best time and space complexity, optimized to the best possible 
4: The algorithm runs well enough, but can be further optimized to get better performance
3: The algorithm adopts a suboptimal method for moderate performances
2: The algorithm adopted is bad designed and will suffer for large inputs.
1: The code has very poor time complexity, making it unusable for non-trivial input sizes.


Readability (1-5):
5: The code is extremely clear and simple. Every line is easy for human to understand, with no unnecessary complexity.
4: The code is generally clear and simple, with minor complexities or ambiguities that do not hinder understanding.
3: The code is readable but contains some complex or ambiguous parts. 
2: The code has significant complexity or ambiguity, making humans need to spent a long time pondering
1: The code is poorly written that makes humans almost unable to understand.
