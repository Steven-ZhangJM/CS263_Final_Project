Python code to solve this problem:

```Python
import math

# Function to calculate number of rectangles in a grid
def count_rectangles(width, height):
    return width * (height + 1) // 2

# Initialize minimum difference and nearest area
min_diff = float('inf')
nearest_area = None

# Loop through possible widths and heights
for w in range(1, 100): # We can assume the grid is not too large
    for h in range(1, w + 1):
        # Calculate number of rectangles in this grid
        num_rectangles = count_rectangles(w, h)
        
        # Check if difference with 2000000 (2 million) is smaller than current minimum
        diff = abs(num_rectangles - 2000000)
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            nearest_area = w * h

# Print the result
print("The area of the grid with the nearest solution is:", nearest_area)
