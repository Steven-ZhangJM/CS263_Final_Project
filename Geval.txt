You will be given one code answer for a math question.

Your task is to evaluate the quality of this answer from three perspectives:

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. 

Evaluation Criteria:

Correctnessï¼š Measures whether the code solves the problem as expected. If the code provides correct results and has no logical errors, it can be given a high score. If the code has errors or gives incorrect results, a low score should be given. Score range: 0-5.

Efficiency: Measures the efficiency of the code in terms of time and space. This includes time complexity and space complexity. If the code has low time and space complexity, it can be given a high score. A low score should be given if the code has high time or space complexity. Score range: 0-5.

Readability:Measures how easy the code is to read and understand. This includes things like the clarity of variable names, the structure of the code, and the quality of comments. If the code is easy to read and understand, it will score high. If the code is difficult to understand or the structure is confusing, a low score should be given. Score range: 0-5.


For the question:
{{Question}}.

Here is the code answer for this question:
{{Answer}}.

Evaluation Steps:
Start: Initialize Correctness, Efficiency, and Readability to 100, and you should set a scoring guideline for yourself!

Correctness: Checks that the code produces the correct output for the given problem. If you make a mistake somewhere, deduct points, and you can decide how many points to deduct based on the size of the mistake.

Efficiency: Analyze the efficiency of the code in terms of time and space complexity. If the time-space complexity is high, a larger number of points should be deducted.

Readability: Evaluate how easy the code is to read and understand.

Provide a score for each criterion from 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest. Do not output detail descrivetion,Do not output detail descrivetion,Please only output the content after output.
