3: The overall logic is correct, but there are some noticeable mistakes that makes the result wrong. 
2: The code has bad logic, resulting in wrong execution outputs
1: The code completely makes no sense, and the output is wrong.


Efficiency (1-5): 
5: The algorithm runs at the best time and space complexity, optimized to the best possible 
4: The algorithm runs well enough, but can be further optimized to get better performance
3: The algorithm adopts a suboptimal method for moderate performances
2: The algorithm adopted is bad designed and will suffer for large inputs.
1: The code has very poor time complexity, making it unusable for non-trivial input sizes.

For the question:
\nIf we list all the natural numbers below $10$ that are multiples of $3$ or $5$, we get $3, 5, 6$ and $9$. The sum of these multiples is $23$.
Find the sum of all the multiples of $3$ or $5$ below $1000$.
\n

The ground truth Answer of this question is:
\n

def compute():
	ans = sum(x for x in range(1000) if (x % 3 == 0 or x % 5 == 0))
	return str(ans)

For the question:
\nThe binomial coefficient $\displaystyle \binom {10} 3 = 120$.
$120 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 5 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 5$, and $2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 14$.
So the sum of the terms in the prime factorisation of $\displaystyle \binom {10} 3$ is $14$.
